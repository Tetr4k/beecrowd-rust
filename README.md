## Just solving some beecrowd questions to learn and practice Rust programming

### I made a script to automate creating the program file from a template. To use in linux(After set executing permission):

```
  ./create.py <question number> <tests>
  #Create a paste with the main program file and the test text files
```

```
  ./test.py <question number>
  #Execute the program for each test text files, returning the output.
```
